### Project: Thunder Cats

Thunder Cats is a desktop application that can help NUS Year 2 Computer Science students who are doing group projects
organise primarily the contacts of their group mates so that they can easily keep track of whom to contact for any group
project. Thunder Cats is optimised for students who can type fast, who prefer typing over using the mouse, and who are 
comfortable with command-line interface applications.
