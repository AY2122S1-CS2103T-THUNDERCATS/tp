### Project: Thunder Cats

ThunderCat (TC) is a desktop app designed for Year 2 Computing Students. You can manage contacts, organise them into project groups and manage your tasks according to the groups. The application is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ThunderCat can get your project groups' management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

**Added Features**
* New Feature : Added ability for Thunder Cat to support `group` functionalities. 
* New Feature : Added ability to add multiple people to an existing group in ThunderCat.
* New Feature : Added ability for Thunder Cat to support `task` functionalities.
* New Feature : Added ability for users to delete a `task` from a specified group in ThunderCat.

**Contribution to team-based tasks**
* Specifically added the `Group`, `UniqueGroupList` and `Task` classes to lay the groundwork for my team to add further functionalities to groups and tasks.
* Team-mates were able to work with a black box and trust that I would be able to implement what they needed in order to implement functions and commands for `group` and `task`.
* Finalised the name, icon and display of the application.
