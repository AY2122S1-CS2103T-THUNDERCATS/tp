### Project: ThunderCat

Thunder Cats is an application to manage computing students group projects and tasks.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to `add` a new `Group` to ThunderCat.
    * What it does: allows the user to `add` a new `Group` to ThunderCat specifying its name and description.
    * Justification: A key feature in the application in order access the `Group Information` page and use other core commands related to groups and tasks.
    * Highlights:
        * The `Name` must be present while `Description` is optional.
        * The `Description` optional field was included only after one iteration and adding it was marginally challenging as there were a lot of affected classes to integrate.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to `remove` group members from existing groups while keeping their contact intact inside the ThunderCat.
    * What it does: allows the user to `remove` other contacts from an existing group with existing contact.
    * Justification: A key feature in the application for users to update their group contacts accordingly instead of having to create a new one from scratch everytime there are changes.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to `edit` a `group` details.
    * What it does: allows the user edit the `Name` and the `Description` of the selected group.
    * Justification: As `Description` is set to be optional, this command not only serves its purpose to edit group details but also add `Description` to groups should they choose to leave it empty the first time.
