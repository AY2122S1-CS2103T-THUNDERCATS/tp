### Project: ThunderCat

ThunderCat is a desktop application that can help NUS Year 2 Computer Science students who are doing group projects organise primarily the contacts of their group mates so that they can easily keep track of whom to contact for any group project. ThunderCat is optimised for students who can type fast, who prefer typing over using the mouse, and who are comfortable with command-line interface applications.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
